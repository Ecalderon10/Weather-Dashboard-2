1. My first step when approaching this project began with sceudo coding the neccarsay functions that this application needed

2. I started off with the HTML and and building the outline of my webpage

3. This included adding all elemenets in the Header,Body,and the Main section of the HTMl

4. When setting all these elements I included Id's and Classes in order to call them in the CSS and JS

5. After finishing the HTML I went on to the JS and started coding out the variables and setting the parameters

6. Once i finished step 5 I went on to get the API's neeeded and storing them in variables in order to be able us them and render them properly

7. Once these variables were in place i went ahead and coded out the Functions needed for the project

8. After wrapping up the JS I made sure all elements were called correctly using jquery.

9.  Once step 8 was finsihed I proceeded to start the CSS and make sure evething was styled 

10. The finishing part to the project was revising functionality and taking into consideration User experience
