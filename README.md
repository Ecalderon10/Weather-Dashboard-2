1. When creating the weather dashboard I began with sceudo coding out the HTML and JS

2. When constructing this project I began with placing ID's and classes in the HTML 

3. After completeing ID's and classes I began putting content into the main, body, and header

4. Once this was finished I started on the JS and started to incomrperate the the variables and calling them by JQuey

5. After setting the neccassary variables I started to pull the API's needed in order to render the proper information to the User

6. Once the API's were finished I began building out the functions needed for the APP to work as intended 

7. Finishing steps 1-6 i began to run all the code making sure the functionality was working properly

8. Once the functionality was displaying correct information from the API's I finished with the CSS styling
